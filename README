conjGrad Poisson - Solve Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential of a 2-D system using the method of conjugate 
gradients. As of now the solver can implement both Intel MKL and OpenCL BLAS subroutines, although the laplacian 
convolution is implemented by me. 

In order to run this, you must have Intel MKL and/or OpenCL/clBlas installed and running on your machine. 
Additionally, OpenGL/glut/GLEW are needed for visualization. Makefile included. 

Special thanks to Swiftless for the GLSL framework and Claudio Rebbi for the foundation/inspiration to do this.

TODO

clean up code
add opencl interop
